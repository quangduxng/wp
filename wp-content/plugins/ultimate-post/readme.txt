### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/advanced-slider-block-of-postx/" target="_blank">Post Slider 2 (Pro)</a>

The second variation of the slider block is a more versatile and advanced variation compared to the first one. It comes with 8 layout variations and all of the variations are multi-device responsive and visually appealing. Not only that but it is also highly customizable like any other blocks of PostX.
 
### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-filter-posts-by-category-and-tag/" target="_blank">Ajax Filters</a> 

Do you want to let the visitors of your site filter posts by specific or multiple categories and tags? PostX offers ajax powered filter. So that, the visitors can explore more posts without reloading the whole posts.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ggGxr65788]

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-pagination/" target="_blank">Ajax Pagination</a> 

Ajax Paginations is similar to the Ajax filter that helps to explore posts without reloading the whole page. PostX offers three types of paginations for its blocks, which include Load More, Navigation, and Numeric pagination. We can use any of the available options and customize it according to our needs. 

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-query-builder/" target="_blank">Query Builder</a> 

The advanced Query Builder of postX helps the users to sort the posts and pages of the posts blocks. There are can be numerous criteria to sort posts, and the Query Builder covers all of the criteria, or I would say all major required criteria.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuGzILsO9rw]

### 🏆 Display Posts

As I have mentioned earlier, the query builder can sort posts, so you can decide and select the criteria to display posts within a block. For that, you can select desired categories, tags, or both of them at the same time. So that, the posts under those categories and tags will be displayed on the block. Furthermore, you can rearrange and organize them in ascending or descending order.

### 🏆 Display Pages

The Query Builder of PostX also allows displaying pages to the blocks. Once, we select the page option from the Sources section we will be able to choose the desired pages by typing the name of the pages.
 
 
### 🏆 Specific Posts 

The Specific Posts option of the Query Builder is used for selecting desired posts by typing the name of the posts. So that only selected posts will be displayed on the blocks.

### 🏆 Custom Selection (Posts and Pages)

The custom selection option helps you display posts and pages simultaneously by selecting them by typing the names.

### 🏆 Quick Query (Pro)

Quick Query is one of the main attractions of the Query Builder. It helps to quickly sort posts by different useful criteria including popular posts, recent posts, random posts, most commented posts, etc.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/popular-posts/" target="_blank"> Popular Posts</a> 

This option helps to display the popular posts on your desired block based on the view count of the posts. There are multiple criteria available for sorting the popular posts. The posts can be sorted by counting the views of 1, 7, or 30 days.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/how-to-show-related-posts-with-thumbnails-in-wordpress/" target="_blank"> Related Posts </a> 

Quick Query of the query builder also allows us to add related posts on single posts, pages, or on the sidebar with thumbnails using a widget based on category and tags. However, you can also use both category and tags at the same time as the criteria of related posts.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-recent-posts-with-thumbnails/" target="_blank">Latest/Recent Posts</a> 

By default, the post blocks of PostX display the latest or recently published posts. However, you can also display the recently modified posts as the latest posts.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzpIj4BGAkk]

### 🏆 Unique Content Group

Before sorting the posts of the blocks, it displays some posts by default. For this reason, it shows as the same posts if the users add the same block twice or more. To avoid this kind of circumstances we have to use the Content Group option. We have to add the same blocks under the same content group. So that, the posts will not be repeated.
 
 
### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/featured-slider/" target="_blank"> Home Page Slider </a> 

PostX has highly customizable responsive image slider blocks that we can use on our custom home page or any pages you want.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/wordpress-breaking-news-ticker-for-postx/" target="_blank">The News Ticker</a> 

The News Ticker is a versatile feature for news magazine websites. Using this WordPress News Ticker, you can show the latest news and post elements with the built-in ticker variations and customizations.

### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/introducing-the-postx-global-styles/" target="_blank">Global Styles</a> 

Tired of the hassle of editing individual blocks? PostX Global Styles lets you edit colors, breakpoints, and editor size globally, allowing you to create proper news, magazine, and portfolio websites with ease.

### PostX Addons

If the features are not enough for your site you can start using the addons of PostX to add more functionalities that are reauired to create News Magazine or any kinds of blogs.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/elementor/" target="_blank">Elementor Addon</a>

The Elementor addon is for those users who want to add the blocks of PostX while editing the page. For that, 
you have to use both of the saved templates and Elementor at the save time to create a custom design with PostX blocks and save it as a template, 
later use the template while editing the page with Elementor.


### 🏆 <a href="https://www.wpxpo.com/postx/addons/category/" target="_blank">Category Addon</a>
